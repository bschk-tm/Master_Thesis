Investigation of the coupling of physics-informed neural networks and FE methods for the efficient design of structures
made at the Institut of Structural Analysis (ISD) TU Braunschweig

the repository contains all relevant code needed for the creation of examples and numerical calculation
the saved models of the trained neural networks are also included
